FROM DMRG:

Hello everyone!

Thank you for your interests!

The group is aimed at anyone who is interested in the data mining, and no background is really needed.

Usually I will release some classic/latest interesting data mining papers to members to read before we meet. And feel free to ask and share anything!

No worries, the members are all students from our departments and the atmosphere are set to be easy and cozy~

The time will be 5-6pm every Friday, and the classroom are Room 341 in iSchool.

For this week, we are about to read papers on latest AI development (Deepmind) in electronic games (Starcraft II). Below are the technical report and two comments and the reviews.
